Feature: move (rename) file
  As a user
  I want to be able to move and rename files asynchronously
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given using new DAV path
    And user "user0" has been created
    And the administrator has enabled async operations

  Scenario Outline: Moving a file
    When user "user0" moves file "/welcome.txt" asynchronously to "/FOLDER/<destination-file-name>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "202"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions
      | OC-JobStatus-Location | /%base_path%\/remote\.php\/dav\/job-status\/user0\/[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/ |
    And the oc job status values of last request for user "user0" should match these regular expressions
      | status | /^finished$/      |
      | fileId | /^[0-9a-z]{20,}$/ |
    And the downloaded content when downloading file "/FOLDER/<destination-file-name>" for user "user0" with range "bytes=0-6" should be "Welcome"
    And user "user0" should not see the following elements
      | /welcome.txt |
    Examples:
      | destination-file-name |
      | नेपाली.txt              |
      | strängé file.txt      |
      | C++ file.cpp          |
      | file #2.txt           |
      | file ?2.txt           |

      | permissions | 1         |
      | shareWith   | user0     |
    When user "user0" moves file "/textfile0.txt" to "/testshare/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    When user "user0" downloads the file "/testshare/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"

  #this does not work if firewall app is enabled
  #and it also does not work with the php-dev server
  Scenario: Moving and overwriting a file
    #need to slowdown the request for longer than the timeout
    #when doing LazyOps the server does not close the connection
    #so we timout the request and chech the job-status
    Given the HTTP-Request-timeout is set to 5 seconds
    And the MOVE dav requests are slowed down by 10 seconds
    When user "user0" moves file "/welcome.txt" asynchronously to "/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "202"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions
      | OC-JobStatus-Location | /%base_path%\/remote\.php\/dav\/job-status\/user0\/[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/ |
    And the oc job status values of last request for user "user0" should match these regular expressions
      | status | /^started$/      |
