    And the administrator logs out of the webUI
    And the user logs in with username "guiusr1" and password "pwd" using the webUI
    Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Files - ownCloud"

  Scenario: use the webUI to create a user with special valid characters

    And the administrator logs out of the webUI
    And the user logs in with username "@-_.'" and password "pwd" using the webUI

  Scenario Outline: use the webUI to create a user with special invalid characters
    When the administrator attempts to create a user with the name <user> and the password <pwd> using the webUI
    Then notifications should be displayed on the webUI with the text
      |Error creating user: Only the following characters are allowed in a username: "a-z", "A-Z", "0-9", and "_.@-'"|
    And the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Users - ownCloud"
    Examples:

      |"a#%"|"pwd1"|
      |"a+^"|"pwd2"|
      |"a)~"|"pwd2"|

  Scenario: use the webUI to create a simple user with an Email address but without a password
    When the administrator creates a user with the name "guiusr1" and the email "guiusr1@owncloud" without a password using the webUI
    Then the email address "guiusr1@owncloud" should have received an email with the body containing
      """
      just letting you know that you now have an ownCloud account.
      
      Your username: guiusr1
      Access it:
      """

  Scenario Outline: user sets his own password after beeing created with an Email address only
    When the administrator creates a user with the name "<username>" and the email "guiusr1@owncloud" without a password using the webUI
    And the administrator logs out of the webUI
    And the user follows the password set link received by "guiusr1@owncloud" using the webUI
    And the user sets the password to "newpassword" using the webUI

      | string | no @ sign     |
      | a@     | no domain name|
      #there would be much more to test here, but its complicated and would be slow
      #see http://codefool.tumblr.com/post/15288874550/list-of-valid-and-invalid-email-addresses
      #email address validation would better go into an unit test
